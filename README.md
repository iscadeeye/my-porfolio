#### My-porfolio
###### This is the only main project I have done since I graduated in August 2021
I took a course called "50 projects in 50 days" taught by *Brad Traversy*
 [50 projects in 50 days](/www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). So The javascript and CSS for the left hand corner buttom that shows and hides my contact are purely from that course
