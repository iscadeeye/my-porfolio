#### My-porfolio
###### This is the only main project I have done since I graduated in August 2021
I took a course called "50 projects in 50 days" taught by *Brad Traversy*
 [50 projects in 50 days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). So The javascript and the CSS for the left hand corner buttom that shows and hides my contacts are purely from that course.
