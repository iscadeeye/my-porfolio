#### My-porfolio
###### This is the only main project I have done since I graduated in August 2021
I took a course called "50 projects in 50 days" taught by *Brad Traversy*
 [50 projects in 50 days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). So The javascript and CSS for the left hand corner buttom that shows and hides my contact are purely from that course.

 I was young and obsolutely had no idea what coding was when I fixed a family member's phone. 
I am interested in this pathway because of two things: I am problem-solver with growth mindset and I am craving for learning. 

I was born and raised  a war torn country and I did not attend school at a young age.
 I came to the United States of America 7 years ago knowing very little English. 
I started taking ESL class to learn the language and right after that I get my GED, and here I am today pursuing  software development career, my dream job.
